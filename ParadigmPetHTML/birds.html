                    Birds are very intriguing creatures as they can range from birds as small as a Cuban bee hummingbird 
                    (about two inches long and a little over 1/20 of an ounce) to as large as an ostrich. While most birds fly, 
                    there are some that don't. Birds are amazing and each breed is unique in its own way, particularly when it 
                    comes to their relational needs and well-being.

                            Unfortunately, birds can experience sadness and depression just like humans. A number of root causes 
                            may be responsible for your bird's depression such as an illness (either physical or mental), losing 
                            its companion, or increasingly becoming bored. Some signs to help identify if your bird is experiencing 
                            depression may include the following:

                            <li>becoming increasingly irritable</li>
                            <li>aggressive behavior</li>
                            <li>songs have a different, more solemn tone</li>

                        Be sure to tell your veterinarian if you see signs of any of these symptoms. Just like many illnesses, 
                        identifying and treating the symptoms earlier may drastically increase the lifespan of your birdie.
